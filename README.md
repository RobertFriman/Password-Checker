# Password-Checker
Summary: Extend the password strength checker to include quantum-resistant cryptography algorithms. The AI component can still analyze password patterns, but now youâ€™ll integrate quantum-safe encryption techniques like lattice-based cryptography to store and protect passwords. \n
Aim: Future-proofs against quantum attacks on traditional encryption methods, making it a valuable security tool. \n
Tech Stack: Python (AI and cryptography), Flask/Django (backend), JavaScript (frontend), IBM Qiskit for quantum simulations.
